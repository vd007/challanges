You are working for a shipping company, that ships products by air. Your
cargo jets transport items between a set of airports. From each airport, you can
travel directly to some subset of the other airports. (Some airports may be too far,
or may not have a safe passageway.) The ability to travel from one airport to
another does not guarantee the ability to travel directly in the opposite direction.

You are about to send out a cargo plane on a trip to pick up a large
shipment of a certain product. Unfortunately, only one other airport has this
product for pickup, and you aren't guaranteed that there is a safe, direct route to
the other airport. You may have to travel through one or more other airports to
get to your final destination. Nonetheless, you wish to ultimately end up at the
airport that has your desired product, and which you can get to by travelling the
shortest possible distance.

You are to return a double indicating the number of miles travelled by the
cargo plane along the optimal route from the origin to the destination. If no such
route exists, return -1.

Given two coordinates, (lat1, lon1) and (lat2, lon2), the shortest distance
between them is across an arc known as a great circle. The arclength along a
great circle, between two points on the earth can be calculated as:
radius * acos(sin(lat1) * sin(lat2) + cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * cos(lon1 - lon2))

For purposes of this problem, assume that the radius of the earth is 4000
miles. You are given the latitude and longitude coordinates of each airport in
latitude and longitude. The i-th element of latitude corresponds to the i-th element

of longitude. You are also given canTravel. The i-th element of canTravel is a space-
delimited list of the 0-based indices of the airports that can be reached from

airport i. Finally, you are given origin and destination, the indices of the airports
at which you start and end your trip.
